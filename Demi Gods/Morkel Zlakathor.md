# Description
Born to an orcish chieftess of the Zlakathor tribe, Morkel grew up among the orcs. When he reached puberty he started showing signs of being different. Soon after he was kidnapped by his real father, [[Itereo - God of Travel]]. Itereo had, unbeknown to anyone, impregnated Morkel's mother. When Morkel's powers began to show, Itereo brought him to his home. Itereo wanted a son, but Morkel yearned to return to the people who raised him. 
He secretly pretended to like his new father as he tried figuring out how to return. In the mean while he received a lot of training. He became especially gifted with illusion magic and one day tricked his father and escaped back to Atozia. He didn't know that time works differently the upper planes, so when he returned after what seemed like a couple of years, he realized a century had passed by and everyone he knew was gone. It is said he now wanders the roads, disguised as merchants or travelers. If mortals encounter him he might reward them if they are friendly, or trick them if they deserve it.
