Hexion+Mortal Dragonborn= The Green Dragonborn Demigod, Gargon.
# Description
His mother was a green dragonborn and was seduced by [[Hexion - God of Medicine]]. Shortly after Gargon was born, his mother was hit with a deadly plague and perished. This was of course the doing of the god of sickness. Gargon build The Citadel Of The Sun but when he died during [[1A - The Battle of the Gods (TBOTG)]], the citadel sunk into a huge rift and became known as The Sunless Citadel. Around a thousand years later a druid named Belak finds the corpse of Gargon. He uses the remains to create The Gargon Tree which produces a single fruit every solstice. At summer solstice, the fruit cures any illness if consumed. In the winter, the fruit is deadly. The fruits contain a few seeds that grow into Twig Blights. A living creature will be consumed over 24 hours if it gets bound to the tree. This will turn the creature into a thrall of The Gargon Tree.
