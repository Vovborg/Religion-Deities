# Stories & Fables
## The First Healing
The mortals of Atozia tell a cherished tale about the birth of healing itself. Long ago, when pain and injury first entered the world, a mortal child fell ill, and the people despaired. They prayed to the heavens, but the other gods were busy with their own domains. Only Apaxia answered.

Disguising herself as a humble halfling woman, she walked among the mortals, teaching them the first acts of healing: how to bandage wounds, brew soothing tonics, and comfort the spirit. When the child recovered, the people realized the true nature of their visitor, and they vowed to honor her gift by helping one another, as she had taught them.
## The Healing of Prysta, Goddess of War
During a long-forgotten war, Prysta, the Arch Deity of War, was gravely wounded - her fiery blade shattered, her divine strength drained. Yet her pride prevented her from seeking help. She limped through the lands, leaving a trail of blood and broken ground, until she collapsed before one of Apaxia’s temples.

In the fable, Apaxia descended to her in her darkest hour. She did not berate her for his stubbornness or her endless thirst for conflict. Instead, she whispered words of forgiveness and used her boundless power to heal even her divine wounds. It’s said that when she woke, Prysta wept for the first time, vowing to fight not only for conquest, but to protect those who could not protect themselves.
## The Radiant Bond
Long ago, the world was dark and lifeless. Apaxia, the Mother of Mothers, held a fragile spark of life in her hands, nurturing it with care. But the spark was weak and could not grow in the endless shadows.

Drox, the Arch Deity of Light, saw her struggle and approached her with a warm, gentle glow. "Let me help," he said. Drox cast his radiant light over the spark, and it began to flourish, becoming the first living beings in the world.
But the shadows grew jealous and tried to snuff out the light and life. Apaxia stood firm, shielding her creations, while Drox’s light burned brightly, driving the darkness away. Together, they protected the spark and brought hope to the world.

From that day on, life and light have been bound together, each making the other stronger. It is said that where there is life, Drox’s light will always guide the way.
