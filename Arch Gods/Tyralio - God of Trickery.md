# Way of worship



# Realm & Residence
[[Labyrinthia, Tyralio's Maze.md]], is a neutral plane, where souls devoted to Tyralio go. As the name suggests, the entire plane is one big labyrinth containing everything from cities to wilderness. The layout is quite confusing with many dead ends, impossible stairs and irregular gravity. In addition, illusion magic runs rampant, creating sometimes humorous - sometimes deadly situations. 
Tyralio's Palace lies in the center of the labyrinth, and legend says that anyone that can find their way there, will be granted a wish and permanent residence there. This challenge becomes the goal for many of the souls spending their eternity here. 
# Stories & Fables
> Which stories has the deity been part of? Are there any lessons learned from these stories? How are these fables integrated into culture and language?
