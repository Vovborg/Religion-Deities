# Alignment
Chaotic Good
# Name
Drox, The Sun Dragon, Eldest
# Appearance and depiction
Drox has always stood out among the other [[Arch Gods - The Eight Arms]] because he is the only one which true form is not humanoid. His true form is a majestic dragon with scales made of pure light. He is known to take humanoid form as a perfected version of a dragonborn often with jade scales.

His nature is very two-sided and no one can predict which stance he will take on an issue as he often has his own agendas and reasoning behind his choices. This is very much reflected in his twin sons; [[Angra - God of Chromatic Dragons]], and [[Ahura - God of Metallic Dragons]] which are evil and good in nature respectively. 

His first-born was his daughter, [[Nox - Goddess of Night]] which was manipulated and corrupted by [[Zhintos - God of Death]], which managed to turn her from neutral natured to pure evil. Nox became the Goddess of Darkness & Night and every time Drox rests or is distracted, Nox awakes and covers the world in night.

# Stories & Fables
## The Prism of Truth
**Summary**: In this tale, a mortal king beseeches Drox for aid, as his kingdom is falling into chaos due to lies and treachery among his court. Drox gifts the king a radiant prism, which can separate truth from falsehood when held in sunlight. However, the king, consumed by ambition, begins using the prism to exploit and blackmail his subjects. Enraged by the betrayal, Drox shatters the prism, scattering its fragments across the world. These shards are said to be hidden in places only the virtuous can reach.
## The Twin Blessings
**Summary**: This fable explains how Drox’s twin sons, the God of Chromatic Dragons and the God of Metallic Dragons, came to embody evil and good. Drox gave each son a gift at their birth: the chromatic child received his boundless ambition, and the metallic child received his radiant compassion. But Drox, being unpredictable by nature, did not guide them in how to use these gifts. The tale serves as a cautionary tale about balance and responsibility.
## The Shattered Dawn
**Summary**: In an epic battle with Nox, Drox’s light was temporarily extinguished, plunging the world into an age of darkness. However, a single mortal, a blind musician, kept faith in Drox’s return. She composed a hymn so beautiful that it reignited Drox’s light, breaking the darkness and restoring day. This tale is often retold as an allegory for hope and resilience in the face of despair.
