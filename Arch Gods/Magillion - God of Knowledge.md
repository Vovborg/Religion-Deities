## The Star-Changing Question
Long ago, the stars were fixed and unmoving. A humble shepherd, gazing at the night sky, wondered aloud, "Why do the stars stand still?" His question awakened something in the universe, and the stars began to shift, forming constellations and guiding travelers. Magillion appeared to the shepherd and declared, "It is your curiosity that sets the cosmos in motion." From then on, the faithful believe that every question asked brings new light to the world, just as the shepherd’s question lit the heavens.
