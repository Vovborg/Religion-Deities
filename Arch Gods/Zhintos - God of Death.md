# Description
As the God of Death, Zhintos is not able to create life by himself. He is able to create soulless beings and undeads. He can only twist and corrupt creatures that already posesses life.

By cooperating with [[Drox - God of Light]], he created the first devil, [[Akumet - God of The Hells and Devils]]. He wanted to create his own races like the other Arch Gods had done, and as an insult asked Drox to make the first devil to be human-like, though with red skin, charcoal hair, two large horns, fangs and a spiked tail. Zhintos assigned Akumet to reign over [[The Nine Hells]].

> Examples: Itereo, God of travellers does not have any organized religion. Anyone who needs to travel might worship Itereo. Shrines of Itereo are placed by roads all over the country. An unwritten rule dictates that offerings for other travellers are placed upon the shrine and any traveller in need can freely take anything on the shrine. Taking offerings due to greed and not need, is a severe offense in the eyes of other people and is it said that Itereo will curse their travels.
