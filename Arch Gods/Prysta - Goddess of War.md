# Way of worship
### Temples
Often referred to as 'Prystan War Halls', her temples are most often fortresses adorned with battle relics, skulls of enemies, and blood-soaked banners. The temples are often decorated sparsely with expensive things, but rather with stuff of practical use. 
Training and drills are often practiced at the temples. And many warriors too old or physically unable to partake in actual battle anymore retire at these temples, becoming devoted masters sharing their knowledge with the youth. 
### Rituals & Practices
**Blood Oaths**
Warriors make blood pacts in Prysta's name, promising their undying loyalty and courage in battle.

**Blood Paint**
It is common during a battle to take some of the blood from your first kill and smear it across your face. Both as a gesture for Prysta, and as an intimidation tactic. 

**Burial Pyres**
It is common to be burned, when worshippers fall in battle. Individual or mass burning are common, and being burned in a pile of your allies or enemies is seen as a great honor. 
It also has its practical reasons; large amounts of dead bodies having to be buried takes much more effort than burning them. It also prevents any enemies to take body parts as trophies.
