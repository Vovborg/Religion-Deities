# The Myth of Creation
> *In the beginning, there was but the Creator, who existed before all things. From the depths of the void, the Creator wrought all that is known. In their infinite wisdom, they fashioned the eight sacred domains, commencing with the gift of **LIFE**. Yet, the Creator beheld naught but emptiness and thus summoned forth the **LIGHT** to illuminate their creations. Though the Creator dwelt and gazed upon the world, they had no place to call home. Hence, they brought forth **NATURE** to adorn the world.*
> 
> *The world was serene, yet it failed to satiate the Creator's longing for wonder. Thus, they called forth the **TEMPEST**, which flooded the land, rendering it both beautiful and grim. The Creator surveyed their work, discerning that all was still and unchanging. Therefore, they bestowed upon their creations the boon of **KNOWLEDGE**, that they might evolve and grow. With knowledge came desires, and with desires arose the specter of WAR. The Creator observed as the fires of conflict engulfed their domains.*
> 
> *As time passed, the wars grew ever more dreadful, and the Creator's heart was no longer pleased. In response, they conjured **TRICKERY**, a force to undermine the tyranny of war. Those who mastered the ways of trickery possessed the power to triumph over any army. At last, the Creator found contentment in their creation. Yet, there remained an absence, a void that gnawed at their being.*
> 
> *Eons did the Creator ponder upon this missing element, until at last, they reached the end of their contemplation. Life, light, nature, tempest, knowledge, war, and trickery had all become as nothing to them. The Creator felt the void encroach once more. And so, the Creator did relinquish their own life, and in their passing, they birthed the final domain that had eluded them: **DEATH**.*

>[! Old Creation Myth]+
The Creator was before everything. They created everything from the void. They created the eight domains, beginning with creating LIFE. They realized they saw nothing and created LIGHT. The Creator lived and saw, but had nowhere to be. They then created NATURE. The world was peaceful but boring to the Creator which prompted them to create the TEMPEST, which flooded much of the land. The world was now filled with both beautiful and grim things. The Creator inspected every inch of his creations and realized they were stagnant and still. They therefore created KNOWLEDGE as a tool for their creations to evolve. With knowledge came desires and with desires came WAR. The Creator watched as the wars between his domains razed. After a while the wars became so horrific that they did not please the Creator anymore. They then created TRICKERY as a means to dismantle the power of war. The ones who fares in the domain of trickery have power to overcome any army. The Creator was finally content with his creation. Except there was one thing missing. And the Creator spend eons contemplating was that thing was. At last the Creator was done. There was nothing more to life. All their creations: life, light, nature, tempest, knowledge, war and trickery had become nothing to them. The Creator felt they were in the void once again. Thus the Creator took his own life away again and the Creator died. Their demise birthed the one thing missing from their creation; DEATH.

# Ink of Creation
As an octopus, Atoz possessed The Ink of Creation with which he painted everything into existence. The death of The Creator allowed for the birth of other divine beings. From where their eight tentacles fell, eight gods sprouted. These gods were tasked with governing the eight domains of The Creator.
