# Alignment
Alignment is a broad way to categorize your deity's nature. This does not mean two gods with the same alignment will agree on everything. Alignments explained: [https://dnd5e.info/beyond-1st-level/alignment/](https://dnd5e.info/beyond-1st-level/alignment/)

Example: Chaotic Good

Title and Aliases

Examples: God of Thunder. The Old One.

# Name
Names do not necessarily need to have meaning, but it can be challenging to invent a new name from thin air. A simple way to come up with a meaningful name is to take some words that represent the deity and translate them to Latin or another language. Then you can tweak it so the word sounds more like a name. It can be a good idea to say the name out loud a few times, because some names may look cool on paper, but may be too hard or awkward to pronounce.

Example: Thunder - Tonitrum - Thonitas = Thonitas, God of Thunder
