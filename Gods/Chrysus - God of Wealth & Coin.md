# Description 
The God of Coin is known as Chrysus. In the early days of the Second Age [[Magillion - God of Knowledge]], received many prayers concerning the problematic ways of trading wealth from his civil followers. Magillion's brother [[Tyralio - God of Trickery]], came to Magillion with an idea; currency. Magillion pondered this and agreed. Tyralio was clever and had foreseen how coin could create chaos. Together they created Chrysus, the God of Coin and Wealth.

Fortune well are constructed in most major cities and it is believed any valuables thrown in the well will come back tenfold.
