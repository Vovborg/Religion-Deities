Vequos is worshipped mainly in The Golden Strait and people specializing in riding. Vequos is son of Faunos and Floros and was a beautiful human-like man. He loved riding and taming steeds so much it became an obsession. One day he came upon the most beautiful stallion with a golden horn and feathery wings gracing peacefully in a clearing. He did not know this was Faenira's personal mount: Areion. Vequos managed to actually mount the stallion, equipped him with reigns and rode him into the sky. Vequos was reckless though and managed to crash into a mountain killing Areion. When Faenira found out she became furious and cursed Vequos turning him into a horse with the likeness of the dead Areion. He was made to become her steed never again to become a rider himself. This went on for many years until Vequos saved Faenira's life in battle. She decided at that point, that Vequos was redeemed and he was turned back into his original form. From then on he still retained the ability to turn into the winged horse and voluntarily offered to be Faenira's steed whenever she needed it.

Worship:

The churches of Vequos is commonly referred to as Vequos' Stables. The churches are often large as they always consist of an arena for horse training and riding competitions. The clergy devotes their lives to breeding, training and caring for the horses of their church, sometimes specializing in certain breeds. Horses from a Vequos Stable are very prestigious and can only be bought by people trusted by the church. Their main concern is their horses' wellbeing and monks sometimes travel unannounced to their customers to inspect and ensure the horses are treated well. If the horse has been mistreated, the church will reclaim it and the customer will be banned for three generations.Â
