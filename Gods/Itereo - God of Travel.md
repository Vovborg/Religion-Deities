# Description
Itereo is the offspring of [[Knutra - Goddess of Tempest]] and [[Tyralio - God of Trickery]]. He became the patron god of travelers and exploration. 

Itereo grew up in his mother's domain with his brother, [[Tu'kash - God of Storms & Thunder]], but soon started travelling the realm. He is known to be the god, that has experienced most of Atoz' creation. He trades his knowledge of the planes with [[Magillion - God of Knowledge]] which is constantly trying to learn more. In return Itereo gets information about his fellow gods. It is unknown what he uses this knowledge for. Once in a while Magillion grants Itereo a magic item, which he pockets in his pouch.
# Appearance & Depiction
Itereo appears as beautiful gnome with a curled brown moustache. He wears travelling cloak and humble travelling gear and only a small pouch at his belt.


# Worship & Worshippers
Travelers, explorers, merchants, cartographers and anyone looking to transport themselves through the somewhat dangerous lands of Atozia. 

Due to their natural inclination to explore and sate their curious minds, gnomes are often worshippers of Itereo. 
Itereo is also known for his amazing tales and is the patron of many bards who wish to be great storytellers. His followers are encouraged to explore the world and share their experiences with others to inspire. They are encouraged to help travelers on the road and he might punish someone who attacks his travelling worshippers.

Shrines of Itereo are often found on the road where travelers have died, in harbor towns and in taverns. People offer things like clothing, food and gold at these shrines for travelers in need to take freely.
The closest thing to actual temples of worship are merchant- and cartography guilds.
