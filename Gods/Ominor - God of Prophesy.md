Born as a blind mortal human, Ominor had vivid dreams and visions of becoming a god since early childhood. He knew he was destined to it. People thought he was mad and laughed at him. No one believed ascension to divinity as possible, least of all that a blind man would be able to. After many decades of studying and ignoring the ridicule of his peers he somehow manged to ascend to divinity. He was welcomed by Magillion, who reveals he gave Ominor the gift of prophesy. Ominor allied himself with Annos to better his prophesies and they reside in limbo.
