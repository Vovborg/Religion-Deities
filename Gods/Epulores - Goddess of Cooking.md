Epulores is the child of the God of Beasts and the Goddess of Plants and his patronage is a result of the combination of both.

Epulores is depicted as chubby elf (which is a rather uncommon sight) with the head of a dog. He wears a large belt with countless vials and pouches.

He grew up in the Eternal Grove with his parents and learn to live off both animals and plants. He became a gastronomical genius and discovered many recipes, that he sometimes lets seep into the minds of his patrons. His patrons are mostly cooks, but anyone who prepares a meal sometimes pray to Epulores that it will be delicious.

Epulores expects his followers to share their food with others who might need it.
