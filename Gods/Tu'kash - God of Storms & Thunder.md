# Description
The God of Storms - Tu'kash. Created to govern the storms as they wrecked the lands.

Tu'kash is known for having a terrible temper, only able to be calmed by his brother [[Itereo - God of Travel]]. Itereo can be very manipulating especially with his stories of legendary travels and adventures, which he uses to calm his brother down. Every time Tu'kash rages, storms appear in the Material Plane.

# Worship & Worshippers
Tu'kash values fairness but often lets his emotions impact his judgements. His followers are encouraged to make something of themselves and be stern, but fair to all people. Loyalty is another important aspect to his worship. When storms in periods of time are rare, people tend to forget Tu'kash and only start praying once the tornado hits. These prayers are rarely answered and some of his church even believe they can worsen the storms.
