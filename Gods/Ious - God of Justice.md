The God of Justice, Iuos, is usually depicted as a child to symbolize the innocent judging the guilty. In his infancy, Ious had inherited his father's curiosity and wandered to the edge of The Eight Heavens and fell of. He plummeted through the cosmos until he landed hard on a piece of rock. His mother, Apaxia blamed Magillion for his curiosity and spend millenia looking for Ious. When she finally found him, he had not grown at all. Though he had formed his rock to become a new plane of existence and was content there. Apaxia let Ious stay and he became the God of Justice to judge every soul leaving the Material Plane.
