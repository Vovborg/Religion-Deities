Navisto is the patron god of sailors. He is a young god and the son of the Goddess of Craftsmanship and Itereo, God of Travellers. Navisto is depicted as a young man with a bald head, a long black beard and usually shirtless with his upper body covered in tattoos. The tattoos depict sailing related things, such as a compass, mermaids and ships. It is said his tattoos are magical and animated, and they can change depending on Navisto's need. For example his compass tattoo on his lower arm acts as an actual compass and can be used to navigate after. He also wear an eyepatch, not because of a missing eye, but to use to adjust eyesight going from the dark deck below to the bright deck above. He usually has ropes wrapped from shoulder to the opposite hip as a sash. The rope is woven from the hairs of her mother Aecora and is able to stretch as long as needed and is unable to break.

Shipyards are often referred to as houses of Navisto and means of worship are done by the craftmanship of sea vessels and actually travelling the seas. There is often just a statue dedicated to him.
