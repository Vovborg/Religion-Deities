Delecsyos is a male god born of [[Tyralio - God of Trickery]] and [[Amaras - Goddess of Love]]. 
# Origin
Legend says that during a festival, Amaras and Tyralio had a drinking contest. Amaras was the challenger and demanded a son if she won and Tyralio would get the recipe to her famous love potion, if she lost. Tyralio confidently accepted and they brought out two barrels of mead. They each started drinking and it soon became apparent that Tyralio would win. But Amaras was conniving and had laced Tyralio's barrel with the love potion. When Tyralio had finished the barrel and won, he had become deeply in love with Amaras. Even though he won, he forgot all about it and was completely seduced. He ended up giving Amaras a son after all and when the deed was done, the effect of the love potion had faded. Tyralio became furious and cursed the child. Amaras birthed Delecsyos who was born with the legs of a goat and goat horns. He came the first Satyr.
